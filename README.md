# Hi, I’m Roshan 👋

I’m a student developer who’s passionate about building things that matter—especially if it means coding late into the night, fueled by curiosity (and the occasional coffee ☕).

**What I do best:**
- Crafting seamless mobile apps with React Native & Expo
- Architecting snappy backends with Node.js & Express
- Wrangling JavaScript for both web and mobile
- Making databases do their magic

**Projects I’m proud of:**
- **Chatty** – A React Native chat app focused on real-time, delightful conversations
- **NetStream** – Free movies and webseries streaming application

My happy place is turning ideas into reality, making software that’s both useful and joyful to use. I believe in minimalist design, clean code, and never losing the spark of fun—because building cool stuff should feel cool, too.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech, collaborating on open source, or just doodling app ideas on a napkin.

Let’s connect and make something awesome together!
